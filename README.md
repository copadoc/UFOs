                      UFOs : What is up there?

# Overview of Project: 
The overall purpose of the project is to create a easy to use website that facilitates the gathering and parsing. Although limited, the html-ran website, can provide information about Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) sightings through a built in search bar; additionally, this table has filters that can help narrow down the desired results, to an extent.

# Results: 
To use the website, it would be simple to read through each of the sightings but there are features built in which allow for easier sorting of data through five different filters which are: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. With these filters, it is easier to parse through the data and find the information we are looking for.

# Summary: 
Although helpful, the webpage has itâ€™s limitations, we can only narrow down our search dictionary so much. In addition, the data that we are able to gather has no visual evidence rendering the data almost as folktale. It would help the credibility of the webpage.
